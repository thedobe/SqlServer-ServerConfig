# SqlServer-ServerConfig
Crawls over a CMS for 'Production' servers for their database inventory, config, etc

Unfortunately, I was unable to save the file which looped through the CMS. This version will only 'loop' for a single host at the moment. :/

I believe all which is required is to include a linked_server for the CRUD statement(s). Don't quote me though. ;D
